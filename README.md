# gerd
## Gerd is an online word party game based on [Taboo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1111/taboo)

Players take turns describing a word or phrase to their partner without using the word itself, similar and opposite words.
In a limited time, each team that described and guessed more words correctly will win.
This repo contains the backend of the game's online implementation.
The game implementation is room-based, which means each player can create a room and share it with other players who he/she wants to play with.
